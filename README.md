Pure CSS Sidebar Toggle Menu with Hidden Checkbox &amp; Sibling Selectors
# Sidebar Mini Project

This is a simple sidebar toggle menu built using only HTML and CSS â€” no JavaScript involved.

I created this as a mini project to understand how we can use a hidden checkbox and sibling selectors to toggle UI components. Itâ€™s a great exercise for anyone learning how pure CSS can be used to create interactive elements.
